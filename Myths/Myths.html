            The realms of this universe are held together by what is known as
            the World tree, its branches or roots reach out to each realm.
            Even if it is called the world tree the actual form or shape of
            the tree is not certain as it is usually seen in glimpses through
            dreams and the only actual physical evidence of it exists in the
            form of the resemblance of roots in some parts of Devorna. Even if
            the form or shape of the tree is unknown the branches can be
            mapped with what is called the Arcane veins as they are very
            similar to blood veins stretching out over the realms. The world
            consists of six realms each governed by its own rules and has its
            own people and countries.

            When you die your soul will travel on the branches of the world
            tree trying to reach the top and while doing that the memories
            tied to the soul will slowly be consumed by the world tree until
            nothing more than the tiniest spark of life is the only thing
            remaining of the soul. At the top the spark is sent back to the
            world to ignite a new life.

                An eternal spark never walks the branches of the tree; they
                shed their memories and linger in the world of the living
                until they find a new body to inhabit and consume the spark of
                that soul to replace it with itself. Because they shed their
                memories it can sometimes create a unique phenomena where
                places can have lingering memories of the past life from an
                eternal spark. If the soul revisits these places they can have
                flashbacks.

                Returners are different, they are strong souls that don't
                become completely consumed while walking the branches and keep
                their memories even after reaching the top. When they return
                back to the living they can maintain some of those memories
                making the new life able to remember a past life.

            Outside the world tree exists the emptiness called Ahnu which translates to empty. It is not impossible to
            say that there might be other world trees as well but no one can say for sure because there is no one who
            has found any evidence of its existence.
            <br>What has been found however is life, strange abominations known as the Oirun’sah’Arin which translates
            into dark child/children and later became shortened to Sahrin. These abominations don’t follow the same
            rules as the creatures of the world tree do, they were created in a world beyond the universe we know.
            Something that seems to be common among the Sahrin is the fact that even if they can appear to have eyes,
            these creatures perceive the presence of scent. Their skin is often pale and their body can differ greatly
            as if their body has reshaped many times based on function or will rather than evolution from generations.
            To make it more understandable, Sahrins would be if the very first lifeform on our earth would, instead of
            evolving through generations and dividing, eternally remain as itself and adapt to its surroundings. This is
            one of the reasons why the Sahrin are considered in many ways superior to any celestial or physical being
            known to us.

              Knowledge is what everyone yearns for, knowledge of the past,
              knowledge of the future, knowledge of the unknown. I've searched
              for more answers than I have questions, I have dug through
              countless of dead to know how to live, I ripped apart thousands
              of memories to understand how to remember. And yet when I
              reached the end of my deceitful journey I only wish that I never
              would have gained the knowledge to step out in the dark, that
              the day I saw a world so empty but yet filled with such fear I
              would not have sought it’s answers. I yearn that whatever
              twisted horror awaits me I shall not live to feel it or hope to
              remember it.
