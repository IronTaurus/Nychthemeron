                        Sahrina who still harbours love and beauty but also madness. Her affection for the mortals
                        became an obsession and a craving. She craves the blood of her apprentices and thus if she would
                        see them she would lash out and eat them. </p>

                    <p id="text-block">Verisa is the old god of truth and justice, was worshiped by large cities in the
                        past and statues of her could be found inside courtrooms. Nobles however did not like her
                        disregard of rank and with time the major cities soon replaced her statues with other gods that
                        could favor the rich and often denied her clerics and apprentices into the courtroom. This led
                        to Verisa becoming more favored and worshiped amongst smaller villages and the poor rather than
                        large cities and nobles. </p>
                    <h3 class="sub-header">Appearence:</h3>
                    <p id="text-block">Verisa visits her worshipers when they are alone in a room, the room would become
                        dark and start to slowly become covered by a black mist, from which a womanly figure is formed
                        with a black gown and a beautiful face white as marble, her eyes closed shut. You would not be
                        able to see her full body as her gown blends into the mist from her waist down. Her hands and
                        arms are as pale as her face with long sharp nails. She speaks gently almost like a whisper and
                        ít is said that if you lie to her, the mist becomes thicker and a black liquid would start to
                        rise from the floor and the more you lie the deeper it becomes.</p>
                    <p id="text-block">Verisa is a kindhearted and just goddess, however, she can deal a grave
                        punishment to those who deserve it.
                        To the small lies and crimes she can be forgiving and give out a simple warning.
                        To the bigger or repeated crimes she is less forgiving and can steal your ability to speak in a
                        horrid nightmare of which she digs out your tongue with her sharp nails.
                        If the committed crime is too severe and death is your punishment, it is said to be exacted
                        inside a nightmare where you would either drown in the black liquid representing your lies as
                        she herself will hold you down or she will keep you in place as she uses her sharp teeth to
                        devour you piece by piece in a demonic fashion.

                    <h3 class="sub-header">Apprentice:</h3>
                    <p id="text-block">Often dressed in contrasting colors of dark and light, the apprentices wear a
                        pendant of black Onyx shaped as a Ring with two wings on opposite sides and an eye that is both
                        closed and open at the same time. A ring of words is inscribed with a simple line stating
                        “Verisa is the light that illuminates the truth through the dark mist of lies!”. The text is
                        often inscribed in Ancient.</p>
                    <p id="text-block">To continue to spread her wisdom, a wandering order called “Truth Seekers” was
                        formed to enact justice to those who deserve it regardless of rank. Typically they would wander
                        the world like nomads and occasionally attend trials like a jury or just in order to make sure
                        each member speaks truthfully.
                        A village can call for a Truth Seeker to be present during a trial often in exchange for food,
                        shelter during their stay and a small gift for their visit. To do this they send a request in
                        the form of a letter leaving it inside a nearby shrine and a wandering Truth Seeker will find it
                        in time. Not every call for a Truth Seeker will be answered.

                    similar to a freesia in appearance, it has large roots and populate through the roots rather than

                    their garden so if you would see this in Mihridahl it is most likely the work of a dedicated
