                        Eternal gods are something whose existence and power is undeniable, they don’t require prayer to
                        enforce
                        their power or existence and very rarely answers any. An example of an eternal god is Soln and
                        Lunre,
                        which are the sun and moon in Mihridahl. The eternal gods maintain the reality and natural
                        order, they also maintain the barrier that exists between the realms so that one realm would not
                        affect the other
                        too much. Because of the way the eternal gods work it is often presumed that they are unaware of
                        the existence
                        of other gods or creatures and simply do their work.

                                    A herald is a being chosen by the circumstances to be an aiding hand for the Ancient
                                    gods.
                                    They maintain the barrier of the realm and they are often drawn to a specific
                                    element
                                    based
                                    on the ancient god they aid.</p><br>

                                <p>
                                    It is not clear if Throkks father, Rovakk, was an actual herald or something else
                                    but he
                                    did
                                    have an ability that could be part of an ancient god of Naerini. His ability to bend
                                    earth
                                    to his will could be proof of that.
                                    An orc by the name of Kovash was proclaimed to be the herald of fire and maintains
                                    the
                                    barrier between Mihridahl and Cha’rhin he is a herald of the red god and can control
                                    fire.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    What power being a herald may give is not known but it is usually connected to the
                                    realm
                                    of that particular god. There may be more than one herald of any one god and it does
                                    not
                                    seem to matter which realm that herald exists in as long as they are close enough to
                                    the
                                    barrier to maintain it.
                                </p><br>
                                <p>
                                    There have been legends of a herald using more than one power from a single god,
                                    such as
                                    Me’teth granting both Darkness and Ice as powers to a single Herald.
                                    Normally a Herald never comes in contact with an ancient god directly, they are
                                    granted
                                    powers and a calling, you don’t hear a voice but rather feel drawn to the weak spots
                                    and
                                    can
                                    see a damaged barrier as a strange shimmer. While the barrier would be explained as
                                    a
                                    wall
                                    of sorts, it is not a clear flat wall and can take different shapes and sometimes
                                    even
                                    be
                                    partial. It is as if the barrier has no definite start or end but rather can exist
                                    anywhere
                                    and everywhere at the same time. Some have mentioned dreams where they have seen the
                                    gods
                                    partly but never have been able to interact with them.

                            Immortal gods are no physical creatures, instead they are ideas and beliefs manifested in
                            Athernis
                            to
                            the point where it has taken the shape of a god.
                            While they are ideas and beliefs manifested they do have a will and that is mainly to spread
                            the
                            idea
                            and belief that created them to the point where everyone is a copy of themself.
                            The power of an immortal god comes solely from their worshippers and cannot be killed by
                            physical
                            means.
                            Immortal gods can under normal circumstances not exist outside Athernis.

                            A mortal god is a mortal being that has reached godhood, this is when they are so powerful
                            that
                            their
                            power rivals the gods and become worshiped.
                            While worshippers can grant them some power in reality most of a mortal god's power is
                            coming
                            from
                            themselves. A mortal god still has a physical form and can be killed by physical means.
