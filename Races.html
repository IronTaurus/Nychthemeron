                        colors from almost all spectrums but more commonly they are silver or blue. They often have long

                    <p id="text-block">High Elves are a branch from the Fey Elves that built settlements near humans and
                        learned to coexist with them. Building cities they started to adapt to their surroundings and
                        became
                        what they are today.</p>
                    <h3 class="sub-header">Appearence:</h3>
                    <p id="text-block">High Elves are known for their sharp ears, much shorter than the others of their
                        kin
                        but still long compared to humans.
                        They often have golden blonde or silver white hair, there are cases where a high elf has other
                        colors but the most known high elf would have blonde hair and long hair that they are very proud
                        of.
                        The skin colors are often pale, and since they always take care of their beauty they often have
                        long
                        nails and a face untouched by battle.
                        High elf dress often in light clothes such as silk in bright colors, they love anything that
                        glimmers so crystals, gold and silver are often worn as jewelry. Heavy metals on the other hand,
                        such as iron gives the high elves a chilling sensation that makes them feel uneasy and weak.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="sub-header">Behaviour:</h3>
                    <p id="text-block">Not at all as secluded as their relatives, high elves cherish their beauty and
                        are
                        not shy to show it for anyone who wishes to adore it. The high elves, unlike the others of their
                        kin, does not shy away from the other races; instead you can often find them mingling with other
                        races even though they often consider them a race of lesser status and beauty. They have a
                        strong
                        affection to beauty and light, often working in high positions and/or crafting of gold, jewelry
                        and
                        silk. Because of their long life span they are known for being expert craftsmen.

                        A typical house of a High elf is that of a bright wooden house with plenty of carved or painted
                        decorations, the house would have many large windows to let as
                        much sunlight
                        in as
                        possible with silken drapes to cover them if needed. A typical high elf does not enjoy living in
                        cold environments and in harsh sleeping conditions.

                        Elves perceive time differently than other races, this is mainly due to their long life
                        span. Similar to how some people won’t notice or rather forget when they do some
                        everyday chores an elf will feel the same about the years that pass. This can result in
                        elves being very selective about what they remember and it is not uncommon for them to
                        not remember names of people they don’t find worthy of remembering. Through their
                        meditation they can handle their memories and can remember things they have forgotten
                        with this method.

                        Mihridahl, they have adapted to the forest and have created a strong bond with it. Amongst these
                        elves are a tradition to travel to visit other tribes as a way to exchange history and culture.

                    <p id="text-block">Probably the closest to their origin as fey elves out of all the elves, very
                        adaptable they can shift colors of their skin or hair according to the nature around them. This
                        often takes years or months of time but happens gradually so some changes may be seen after only
                        a few days.
                        Their hair is often in the colors of leaves and grass ranging from green to orange. And when
                        growing old they tend to get almost bronze like hair and much more gray or brown in color. They
                        have long pointy ears.

                    <p id="text-block">A wood elf feels the most comfortable when near nature. Their deep connection to
                        the forest makes them almost a part of it and can often feel if anything is wrong with it. To
                        get this bound they must live in the forest for a long time. This also causes them to be a bit
                        overprotective towards the forest. They are often wary of other races and dislike any trespass
                        in their forest. Despite this, Wood Elves are very reasonable and help people in need regardless
                        of their race as long as their forest is protected.
                        Wood elves live as one with nature. Not only do their appearance change according to the nature
                        around them they can also prolong their lifespan by binding their life to a single tree in which
                        they live as long as that tree.

                    <p id="text-block">A Darkling or Half demon are the descendants of the unlikely spawn of a demon and
                        another race. Although many can look much like a normal person they often have some twisted
                        nature from their demon blood and there are several places such as Heln that reject and
                        sometimes even hunt down those that are found out to be Darklings. There are many Darklings
                        however and some regions have learned to live with them and try to accept them as any other race
                        even if they get frowned upon from time to time.

                    <p id="text-block">A Darkling could have features similar to that of a typical demon and any other
                        race. Because demons use husk created from fallen souls as their bodies, a Darkling can have
                        many different features from other races. For example: an elf with a demon heritage could have
                        the ears and skin/hair colors of an elf, the horns of a demon and the feathers and wings from
                        a Elestine from whom the demon husk had its form. Thus the demon's only recognisable feature
                        would be their twisted features and the horns they can often grow from anywhere on the body.

                    <p id="text-block">A Darkling can often feel drowsy during a bright day and sometimes a Darkling can
                        feel a slight hunger that never disappears, this however is only a feature from the Darklings
                        with a strong bloodline towards their heritage. A Darkling has the vision of a normal human but
                        they have very keen senses that are heightened when their sight is removed such as during night.
                        They can scent other creatures in their surroundings and can even tell the difference between
                        races by scent alone. A darkling with a strong bloodline towards their heritage feels a slight
                        hunger that seems to never go away. Normally the Darkling with this trait learns to live with
                        this hunger and suppress it, others try to still it by any means necessary. </p>

                        They are a violent race in Mihridahl but this does not mean they can't negotiate with other races however this is more 
                        likely only if they can’t resolve it by force. Throughout history forest orcs have been in war with at least one race 
                        at any point in time which has caused them to be called a war loving race. There are numerous tribes in Mihridahl and 
                        while most have built villages and fortresses other tribes live like nomads pillaging places as they wander the lands.

                        often only consists of a single color of skin. This is mainly because they tend to kill off any offspring with different colored skin.
