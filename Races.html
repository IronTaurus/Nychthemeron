                        race living among the gods but not necessarily as their subjects. They have a strong mind and
                        are
                        in full control of their own thoughts. Among the Elestine there are two types, the Light
                        Elestine who live in the bright parts of Athernis and the Dark Elestine who live in the dark

                        have almost
                        nonexistent pupils while still having an iris. The iris can be
                        different
                        colors from almost all spectrums but more commonly they are silver or blue. They often have long
                        sharp nails and large wings that enable them to fly. </p>

                    <p id="text-block">High Elves are a branch from the Fey Elves that built settlements near humans and
                        learned to coexist with them. Building cities they started to adapt to their surroundings and
                        became
                        what they are today.</p>
                    <h3 class="sub-header">Appearence:</h3>
                    <p id="text-block">High Elves are known for their sharp ears, much shorter than the others of their
                        kin
                        but still long compared to humans.
                        They often have golden blonde or silver white hair, there are cases where a high elf has other
                        colors but the most known high elf would have blonde hair and long hair that they are very proud
                        of.
                        The skin colors are often pale, and since they always take care of their beauty they often have
                        long
                        nails and a face untouched by battle.
                        High elf dress often in light clothes such as silk in bright colors, they love anything that
                        glimmers so crystals, gold and silver are often worn as jewelry. Heavy metals on the other hand,
                        such as iron gives the high elves a chilling sensation that makes them feel uneasy and weak.

                    <p id="text-block">Not at all as secluded as their relatives, high elves cherish their beauty and
                        are
                        not shy to show it for anyone who wishes to adore it. The high elves, unlike the others of their
                        kin, does not shy away from the other races; instead you can often find them mingling with other
                        races even though they often consider them a race of lesser status and beauty. They have a
                        strong
                        affection to beauty and light, often working in high positions and/or crafting of gold, jewelry
                        and
                        silk. Because of their long life span they are known for being expert craftsmen.

                        A typical house of a High elf is that of a bright wooden house with plenty of carved or painted
                        decorations, the house would have many large windows to let as
                        much sunlight
                        in as
                        possible with silken drapes to cover them if needed. A typical high elf does not enjoy living in
                        cold environments and in harsh sleeping conditions.

                        Elves perceive time differently than other races, this is mainly due to their long life
                        span. Similar to how some people won’t notice or rather forget when they do some
                        everyday chores an elf will feel the same about the years that pass. This can result in
                        elves being very selective about what they remember and it is not uncommon for them to
                        not remember names of people they don’t find worthy of remembering. Through their
                        meditation they can handle their memories and can remember things they have forgotten
                        with this method.

                        adaptable they can shift colors of their skin or hair according to the nature around them. This
                        often takes years or months of time but happens gradually so some changes may be seen after only
                        a few days.
                        Their hair is often in the colors of leaves and grass ranging from green to orange. And when
                        growing old they tend to get almost bronze like hair and much more gray or brown in color. They
                        have long pointy ears.

                    <p id="text-block">A wood elf feels the most comfortable when near nature. Their deep connection to
                        the forest makes them almost a part of it and can often feel if anything is wrong with it. To
                        get this bound they must live in the forest for a long time. This also causes them to be a bit
                        overprotective towards the forest. They are often wary of other races and dislike any trespass
                        in their forest. Despite this, Wood Elves are very reasonable and help people in need regardless
                        of their race as long as their forest is protected.
                        Wood elves live as one with nature. Not only do their appearance change according to the nature
                        around them they can also prolong their lifespan by binding their life to a single tree in which
                        they live as long as that tree.

                    <p id="text-block">A Darkling or Half demon are the descendants of the unlikely spawn of a demon and
                        another race. Although many can look much like a normal person they often have some twisted
                        nature from their demon blood and there are several places such as Heln that reject and
                        sometimes even hunt down those that are found out to be Darklings. There are many Darklings
                        however and some regions have learned to live with them and try to accept them as any other race
                        even if they get frowned upon from time to time.

                    <p id="text-block">A Darkling could have features similar to that of a typical demon and any other
                        race. Because demons use husk created from fallen souls as their bodies, a Darkling can have
                        many different features from other races. For example: an elf with a demon heritage could have
                        the ears and skin/hair colors of an elf, the horns of a demon and the feathers and wings from
                        a Elestine from whom the demon husk had its form. Thus the demon's only recognisable feature
                        would be their twisted features and the horns they can often grow from anywhere on the body.

                    <p id="text-block">A Darkling has the vision of a normal human but
                        they have very keen senses that are heightened when their sight is removed such as during night
                        however during a bright day the Darklings can often feel drowsy.
                        They can scent other creatures in their surroundings and can even tell the difference between
                        races by scent alone. A darkling with a strong bloodline towards their heritage feels a slight
                        hunger that seems to never go away. Normally the Darkling with this trait learns to live with
                        this hunger and suppress it, others try to still it by any means necessary. </p>

                        growth rate on their hair and beard so they tend to keep it as long as they can, you can often
                        tell how old a dwarf is based on the length of his/her hair or beard. The hair is a lot thicker
                        and tougher than a humans and also does not easily burn so even if accidents happen near the
                        fire their hair is not always the first thing to burn.
                        Mountain dwarves have various skin colors ranging from pale brown to darker warmer colors. Their
                        hair can be seen in various natural colors often brown or blonde but also almost as dark as
                        black.

                        build large dwarven cities. They are mainly miners and thus have a very keen eye to different
                        ores they can see. They generally dislike having elves meddling with their creations, sometimes
                        due to the conflict many years ago but mainly because of their disagreement of who is the better
                        craftsman. They often include iron in their crafts such as decorative rings of iron in the
                        handle to ward away elves from touching it. </p>

                        Although the name is forest orcs it is a general term to describe the many orc tribes living in
                        the forests and hills.
                        They are a violent race in Mihridahl but this does not mean they can't negotiate with other
                        races however this is more
                        likely only if they can’t resolve it by force. Throughout history forest orcs have been in war
                        with at least one race
                        at any point in time which has caused them to be called a war loving race. There are numerous
                        tribes in Mihridahl and
                        while most have built villages and fortresses other tribes live like nomads pillaging places as
                        they wander the lands.

                        A forest orc is well known for their muscular large body towering up to 3 meters tall with
                        tusks.
                        A forest orc can have different skin and hair color but because they are so territorial a single
                        tribe often only consists of a single color of skin. This is mainly because they tend to kill
                        off any
                        offspring with different colored skin. The reason for it can be traced back to ancient time when
                        an orcs survival was depended on its ability to hide and blend in with the environment,
                        in order to have a higher survival rate of the tribe they would favor the skin color that would
                        work as camouflage in the respective environment the tribe live in and kill their offspring born
                        with a odd colored skin.

                        Mountain Orcs are less usual than forest orcs and the reason is that they live mostly high up in
                        the mountains and do not encounter many of the other races too much.
                        Among the races that do encounter the mountain orcs are the dwarves that under many occasions
                        fought the orcs.

                        A mountain orc has a large upper frame with strong arms and back, but overall their body is
                        skinnier and less muscular than others of their kin.
                        A mountain orc can usually have gray or bronze skin color with dark hair but as a custom a
                        single tribe often only consists of a single color of skin.
                        This is mainly because they tend to kill off any offspring with different colored skin.

                        If a mountain orc tribe becomes too large the food they can gather from the mountain may not be
                        enough for the whole tribe causing the whole tribe to wander down
                        the mountain range to pillage and hunt food. This often causes problems for any village or city
                        near the mountain side and can cause week-long sieges with the tribe in question.

                        A strange type of people much feared by other races maybe because of the fact that they can look
                        identical
                        to them and they kill newborns to replace them with their own, the child is then fed the blood
                        of the
                        newborn to take its appearance.
                        The Dalins are a fairly young race compared to many others. Their creator ”the god of shadows”'
                        made
                        them
                        after his own image walking in the form of others.
                        A Dalin female will die within a year after having conceived twins. The shadow god would visit
                        them to
                        claim
                        their life and bring their spirit through the shadows back to his domain. The shadow god
                        collects his
                        childrens souls and their memories rather than having them return to the world tree.<br><br>

                        Dalins can ‘assimilate’ blood from other creatures to take their shape. This ability is not
                        always
                        perfect
                        and often young Dalins would only be able to take some aspects of the creature and not the whole
                        form.
                        For
                        example shaping their hands into paws, arms into wings, etc.
                        Dalins can also seem like they have thoughts elsewhere and not always focused. This is often due
                        to
                        their
                        ‘calling’ as when they are near forests they can feel the presence of something familiar and
                        feel
                        something
                        calling to them
                        A Dalin child will grow up with strange whispers in their dreams, calling to them. Later they
                        feel the
                        urge
                        to find something, like if they are pulled to venture towards a place they have heard about in
                        their
                        dreams.
                        What happens when they find this place is not spoken of but it is something each Dalin searches
                        for and
                        will
                        never feel complete unless they have found it.
