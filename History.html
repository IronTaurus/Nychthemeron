                        A long time ago the realms were much further apart from each other than what they are now,
                        Athernis
                        and Devorna were closest to Mihridahl allowing the strongest gods and demons to be able to
                        create a
                        pathway over to Mihridahl. A catastrophe however caused each realm to attract each other and
                        Athernis and Devorna crashed into Mihridahl. Both Devorna and Athernis became badly damaged and
                        were
                        almost destroyed, now they are still damaged but at least stable.

                        Naerini that was far apart from Mihridahl was now instead very close allowing several creatures
                        to
                        walk over through the broken barriers of Mihridah, Halflings and elves are some of these
                        creatures.
                        This event also allowed a much easier way to travel between realms and it was no longer only
                        available to greater demons or gods.
                        With time the Ancient gods restored the barriers between the realms but even with the restored
                        barriers they were much weaker than before and creatures could sometimes slip through the
                        remaining
                        cracks.
