                        learned to coexist with them. Building cities they started to adapt to their surroundings and

                    <p id="text-block">High Elves are known for their sharp ears, much shorter than the others of their
                        kin
                        but still long compared to humans.
                        They often have golden blonde or silver white hair, there are cases where a high elf has other
                        colors but the most known high elf would have blonde hair and long hair that they are very proud
                        of.
                        The skin colors are often pale, and since they always take care of their beauty they often have
                        long
                        nails and a face untouched by battle.
                        High elf dress often in light clothes such as silk in bright colors, they love anything that
                        glimmers so crystals, gold and silver are often worn as jewelry. Heavy metals on the other hand,
                        such as iron gives the high elves a chilling sensation that makes them feel uneasy and weak.

                        are
                        not shy to show it for anyone who wishes to adore it. The high elves, unlike the others of their
                        kin, does not shy away from the other races; instead you can often find them mingling with other
                        races even though they often consider them a race of lesser status and beauty. They have a
                        strong
                        affection to beauty and light, often working in high positions and/or crafting of gold, jewelry
                        and
                        silk. Because of their long life span they are known for being expert craftsmen.

                        A typical house of a High elf is that of a bright wooden house with plenty of carved or painted
                        decorations, the house would have many large windows to let as
                        much sunlight

                        possible with silken drapes to cover them if needed. A typical high elf does not enjoy living in

                        Elves perceive time differently than other races, this is mainly due to their long life
                        span. Similar to how some people won’t notice or rather forget when they do some
                        everyday chores an elf will feel the same about the years that pass. This can result in
                        elves being very selective about what they remember and it is not uncommon for them to
                        not remember names of people they don’t find worthy of remembering. Through their
                        meditation they can handle their memories and can remember things they have forgotten
                        with this method.

                            in their forest. Despite this, Wood Elves are very reasonable and help people in need regardless
                            of their race as long as their forest is protected.
                            Wood elves live as one with nature. Not only do their appearance change according to the nature
                            around them they can also prolong their lifespan by binding their life to a single tree in which
                            they live as long as that tree.

                    <p id="text-block">A Darkling or Half demon are the descendants of the unlikely spawn of a demon and
                        another race. Although many can look much like a normal person they often have some twisted
                        nature from their demon blood and there are several places such as Heln that reject and
                        sometimes even hunt down those that are found out to be Darklings. There are many Darklings
                        however and some regions have learned to live with them and try to accept them as any other race
                        even if they get frowned upon from time to time.

                    <p id="text-block">A Darkling could have features similar to that of a typical demon and any other
                        race. Because demons use husk created from fallen souls as their bodies, a Darkling can have
                        many different features from other races. For example: an elf with a demon heritage could have
                        the ears and skin/hair colors of an elf, the horns of a demon and the feathers and wings from
                        a Elestine from whom the demon husk had its form. Thus the demon's only recognisable feature
                        would be their twisted features and the horns they can often grow from anywhere on the body.

                        and tougher than a humans and also does not easily burn so even if accidents happen near the

                        due to the conflict many years ago but mainly because of their disagreement of who is the better
                        craftsman. They often include iron in their crafts such as decorative rings of iron in the
                        handle to ward away elves from touching it. </p>

                        Although the name is forest orcs it is a general term to describe the many orc tribes living in
                        the forests and hills.
                        They are a violent race in Mihridahl but this does not mean they can't negotiate with other
                        races however this is more
                        likely only if they can’t resolve it by force. Throughout history forest orcs have been in war
                        with at least one race
                        at any point in time which has caused them to be called a war loving race. There are numerous
                        tribes in Mihridahl and
                        while most have built villages and fortresses other tribes live like nomads pillaging places as
                        they wander the lands.
                        A typical forest orc shaman uses drums and ceremonial dances to cast their magic.

                        A forest orc is well known for their muscular large body towering up to 3 meters tall with
                        tusks.
                        A forest orc can have different skin and hair color but because they are so territorial a single
                        tribe often only consists of a single color of skin. This is mainly because they tend to kill
                        off any
                        offspring with different colored skin. The reason for it can be traced back to ancient time when
                        an orcs survival was depended on its ability to hide and blend in with the environment,
                        in order to have a higher survival rate of the tribe they would favor the skin color that would
                        work as camouflage in the respective environment the tribe live in and kill their offspring born
                        with a odd colored skin.

                        A forest orc tribe usually don’t become large and this is mainly because of their habit of
                        fighting each other mostly for the role as a chieftain.
                        can happen if the previous chieftain is dead or if someone feels strong enough to take the
                        current chieftain down.

                        Mountain Orcs are less usual than forest orcs and the reason is that they live mostly high up in
                        the mountains and do not encounter many of the other races too much.
                        Among the races that do encounter the mountain orcs are the dwarves that under many occasions
                        fought the orcs.

                        A mountain orc has a large upper frame with strong arms and back, but overall their body is
                        skinnier and less muscular than others of their kin.
                        A mountain orc can usually have gray or bronze skin color with dark hair but as a custom a
                        single tribe often only consists of a single color of skin.
                        This is mainly because they tend to kill off any offspring with different colored skin.

                        the mountain range to pillage and hunt food. This often causes problems for any village or city
                        near the mountain side and can cause week-long sieges with the tribe in question.
