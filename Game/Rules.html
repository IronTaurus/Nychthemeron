                        Realms Of Etharia is a turn based card roleplaying game, the game is sort of a mix between DnD
                        and Magic the Gathering. The game does not have any dice making it less luck based while still
                        retaining some random elements, a calculable randomness so to speak. The way this is that most
                        random elements come in the form of a deck called Action Cards, these cards determine your
                        overall damage value as well as your success rate, much like a dice does in DnD but since the
                        deck has a limited amount of cards you can keep track on how many good or bad cards there are
                        left in the deck.
                        The game features a lot of customizability both by multi classing, adding removing Action Cards
                        in your deck as well as the choice of races.

                                    Armor will block incoming physical damage up to its value each round. Every new
                                    round resets the value. The rules of the armor state the following: “Whenever you
                                    are dealt physical damage, for each point of damage remove an equal number of
                                    armor points and reduce damage taken equal to the number of points removed this
                                    way.”
                                    Armor points are reset at the beginning of the next round.

                                    Temporary points are always used up before the actual ones, this is the same for
                                    Health as well as Armor.

                                    An attack can be physical and/or magical, usually this is determined by the nature
                                    of the attack such as Melee and ranged weapons are physical while spells are
                                    magical. There are also additional types such as fire, radiant, necrotic damage.
                                    While usually the type of damage does not matter much and taking 5 points of
                                    physical damage is the same as 5 points of magic but there are some cases where a

                                    deck, each card is either a Sun or a Moon, whether the sun or moon card is
                                    considered a success or fail is based on the current time being night or day.

                                    A player may also spend Aspiration points based on the respective stat to draw
                                    additional
                                    cards.
                                    For example if a player makes a perception (Mind) check and has a Mind Aspiration of
                                    3,
                                    he/she may choose to spend up to 3 points of that stat to draw that many additional
                                    cards
                                    to increase the chances of succeeding.
                                    Spending these points may be done after seeing the first 3 cards and is replenished
                                    after a long rest.

                                    The DM determines the difficulty of a certain challenge and the player need to draw
                                    a number of success cards corresponding to that difficulty.
                                    For example: if the difficulty is 2 then the player needs 2 success amongst the card
                                    he/she draws.
