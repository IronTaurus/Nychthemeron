                        Realms Of Etharia is a turn based card roleplaying game, the game is sort of a mix between DnD
                        and Magic the Gathering. The game does not have any dice making it less luck based while still
                        retaining some random elements, a calculable randomness so to speak. The way this is that most
                        random elements come in the form of a deck called Action Cards, these cards determine your
                        overall damage value as well as your success rate, much like a dice does in DnD but since the
                        deck has a limited amount of cards you can keep track on how many good or bad cards there are
                        left in the deck.
                        The game features a lot of customizability both by multi classing, adding removing Action Cards
                        in your deck as well as the choice of races.

                                    An attack can be physical and/or magical, usually this is determined by the nature
                                    of the attack such as Melee and ranged weapons are physical while spells are
                                    magical. There are also additional types such as fire, radiant, necrotic damage.
                                    While usually the type of damage does not matter much and taking 5 points of
                                    physical damage is the same as 5 points of magic there are some cases where a
                                    character is resistant to one and not the other. </p>

                            Each new day resets the player's SP and also turns each card over to its sun side.
                            Using cards out of combat works the same way as using them in combat however since Recover
                            normally has no way to restore itself back to its sun side you need to be wary of how you
                            use your abilities in order to not run dry when a battle starts. </p>

                                    Whenever a player makes an ability check, he or she draws 5 cards from the

                                    deck, each card is either a Sun or a Moon, whether the sun or moon card is
                                    considered a success or fail is based on the current time being night or day.

                                    A player may also spend points based on the respective stat to draw additional
                                    cards.
                                    For example if a player makes a perception (Mind) check and has a Mind stat of 3,
                                    he/she may choose to spend up to 3 points of Mind to draw that many additional cards
                                    and add it to the 3 other cards to increase the chances of succeeding.
                                    Spending these points may be done after seeing the first 3 cards and is replenished
                                    after a long rest.

                                    For example: if the difficulty is 2 then the player needs 2 success amongst the card
