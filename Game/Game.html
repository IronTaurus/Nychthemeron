                    <p id="text-block">The Elestine are a race that are what people call angels, they are a bewinged
                        race living among the gods but not necessarily as their subjects. They have a strong mind and
                        are
                        in full control of their own thoughts. Among the Elestine there are two types, the Light
                        Elestine who live in the bright parts of Athernis and the Dark Elestine who live in the dark
                        parts. While they are the same their differences make them seem like two different races. </p>
                    <h3 class="sub-header">Appearence:</h3>
                    <p id="text-block">If the Elestine is a light Elestine their skin are usually very pale and feels
                        almost powdery like, their eyes
                        have almost
                        nonexistent pupils while still having an iris. The iris can be
                        different
                        colors from almost all spectrums but more commonly they are silver or blue. They often have long
                        sharp nails and large wings that enable them to fly. </p>
                    <h3 class="sub-header">Behaviour:</h3>
                    <p id="text-block">The Elestine have sensitive skin and they normally do not
                        like to be touched by others. The feathers in their wings are filled with Arcane energies
                        which
                        allows them to fly. While they do maneuver using their wings they can normally be seen
                        hovering
                        only by stretching them out and do not like landing as their bare feet would then touch the
                        hard
                        surface of the ground. </p>
