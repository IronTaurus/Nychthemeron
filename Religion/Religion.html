                Each creature is born as a part of the world tree, their body is connected to it and they are born and
                die
                as part of it. Apart from that there is also a certain connection to the Eternal Gods, the power from
                the
                sun and moon from light and darkness. Each creature is connected to them to some degree but players have
                a
                strong connection to the Eternal Gods and gain power from them.
                Now some may have another source as well such as an Immortal God or a pact with a Demon but regardless
                of
                that the connection with the Ancient Gods remains to be the majority of their power. Why these people
                have
                this power is not known but there is a name for them, the true children of the tree.

                    <p id="text-block">
                        While many would believe them to be the same thing there is a huge difference between a cleric
                        and
                        apprentice.
                        For any one god there may be clerics but not all gods can have apprentices, while mortal gods
                        may grant
                        their
                        clerics benefits in person such as powerful relics or even abilities the clerics of such gods
                        can never
                        truly
                        channel the power of their god in the same way an apprentice can.
                        A mortal god also never has apprentices because of how their power works, a cleric to a mortal
                        god never
                        grows
                        stronger the closer they are to their god but is instead granted more power at the will of their
                        god.
                    </p>
                    <p id="text-block">
                        An immortal god however grows with their followers and their end goal is to make a perfect
                        world, in
                        other terms
                        a world only populated by copies of themselves. An apprentice gains more power the closer they
                        are to
                        their god,
                        following their god's ideals and way of thinking brings them closer to the god and thus is able
                        to
                        channel more of its power.
                        This is also the reason gods often chose their apprentice based on how alike they are to
                        themselves or
                        how easy they would be to convert.
